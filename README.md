After analyzing the normalized stock price chart from 1998 to 2014, 
Amazon shows the most aggressive growth among the three. Despite a steep drop after the dot-com bubble, 
Amazon demonstrates a strong recovery and sustained upward trend, especially from 2008 onward. By the end of 2014, 
Amazon's normalized price is clearly higher than both Microsoft and Yahoo, 
indicating that it had the highest percentage growth relative to its starting price. Yahoo, in contrast, peaked early but declined sharply and never recovered, 
while Microsoft grew modestly but remained relatively flat during the mid-2000s.
